title: "Low Fidelity Prototype"
metaTitle: "Low Fidelity Prototype | WP"
metaDescription: "A prototype is a simulation of how the primary functionality of the product will work. It allows product teams to initiate discussion with other stakeholders such as domain experts, potential users, decision-makers, etc. Low-fidelity prototyping is an easy way to convert high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts. Should not be so concrete and should NOT look like a finished product."

## Why

The first and most crucial role of lo-fi prototypes is to check and test functionality rather than the visual appearance. The whole idea is to make it look like a sketch so that nobody feels bad changing/challenging it.

It should not be expensive, but easily iteratable to reflect different possibilities. The clear advantage of low-fidelity prototyping is its extremely low cost and fast. 

This type of prototyping stimulates group work and collaboration. It shouldn't require special skills to develop, and more people should be involved in the design process. Mostly non-designers such as experts, users can play an active part in the idea-formulation through a lo-fi prototype.

It is also a great communication tool. It can communicate the value proposition and features of your solution in a non-ambiguous interactive manner.

## How

- Start with 'Paper Prototyping', do this as a group exercise. Pass the idea around until your team is happy and in agreement with a rough feature set. Follow [Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) process for the best results.

- Use a tool to create a clickable wireframe. Brainstorm until the design concepts are concrete enough to go for a hi-fi prototype. You can pass this version around to test with domain experts and users.
