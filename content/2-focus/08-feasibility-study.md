## Why

Once you have a clear understanding of the proposed solution, it is time to assess your product's feasibility. It would help if you did not do this too early in the process, as it may limit your exploration and thinking. Also, it would help if you did not do this too late to avoid wasting time and money trying to build something that is not feasible.

## How

As per [lean startup principles](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), the critical questions to answer in evaluating product feasibility are:

- Should this product be built?
  - Does the problem identify exist?
  - Can the solution solve the problem effectively?
- Can we build a sustainable business around this?
  - Will users pay "enough" for solving this problem?
  - Will they buy the product from us?
- Can this product be built?
  - Technical feasibility
  - Resource availability

### Financial Feasibility

Create a budget for the next X years of operation. Start with expected income and the investments available. List your engineering and operational costs to derive an income statement and a cash flow analysis. Calculate if the project can give the expected RoI. Clearly outline the critical success factors such as sales targets, etc.

### Operational Feasibility

Some business models may require a substantial operation on the ground, such as onboard users, managing delivery, etc. You should validate the availability of knowledge, competency and resources to carry out the required ground operations.

### Market Feasibility

Calculate the market size and potential share you may capture with your product. Filling an existing market gap through a unique offering is key to success. Analyze the competitors in the market to assure that you have a clear edge and a plan to capitalize the market void. Also consider the growth and stability of the market for a new business to get established.

### Technical Feasibility

Finally, you should evaluate if the proposed solution is technically feasible. There are several aspects you may consider:

- Is the selected technologies are mature/stable to deliver the functionality
- Is your users capable and resourceful to use the solution offered
- Do you have access to required data and integrations integrations
- Are you able to acquire the necessary regulatory permissions
