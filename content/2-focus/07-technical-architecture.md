## What

Verify if the solution is technology feasible to implement with available resources.

Technical architecture defines and justifies the decisions and constructs of the underline platform of the software product. It includes functional and non-functional considerations, tech-stack selection, architecture diagrams, deployment platform, and DevOps process.


## Why

Technical architecture defines and justifies the decisions and constructs of the underline platform of the software product. It includes functional and non-functional considerations, tech-stack selection, architecture diagrams, deployment platform, and DevOps process. This helps product teams to make decisions for the product respecting the system goals defined by the stakeholders or the domain. 


## How

Technical architecture is defined in a document which layouts the functional and non-functional requirements of the product. It typically includes,
- Background
- Requirements
  - Functional (What the system should do?)
  - Non-Functional (With what should the system deal? E.g. Performance, Load, Data Volumes, SLA etc...)
- Executive Summary
- Architecture Overview
  - Diagrams
  - Technology stack (E.g. Data store, Backend, Frontend)
  - Deployment platform (E.g. AWS cloud, Digital Ocean etc...)
  - DevOps Process
