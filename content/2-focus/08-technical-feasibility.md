## Why

It is essential to verify the selected technologies are feasible enough to build the proposed system. Make sure to create Proof of Concept (POC) application with the selected technologies. It will help to identify any issues and suggest alternatives for each technology.

## How

Some issues to consider when determining technical feasibility.

- Technology Issues

  - Performance
  - Ease of learning
  - Ease of deployment
  - Ease of support
  - Operational characteristics (i.e. can it run 7 days a week, 24 hours a day?)
  - Interoperability with your other key technologies
  - Scalability

- Market Issues

  - Vendor viability (i.e. is it likely that they will be in business in two years? In five?)
  - Alternate sources for the technology, if any
  - Third-party support for related products and services
  - Level of support provided by the vendor
  - Industry mindshare of the product (i.e. is the market gravitating toward or away from this technology?)
