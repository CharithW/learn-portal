Regardless of how well the product is built and maintained, there is always a sun-setting time. Retirement can be called upon by a significant technology shift, competitor entrance, or user behavior change in the market.

Such may require you to re-invent the technology platform/business model/user experience to keep an edge in the market. ISVs should be watchful to identify this need to disrupt their business model before a competitor does.

When a next-gen product is planned, it is essential to do it with minimal disturbance to the existing customers, revenue, and market share. There has to be clear and pain-free migration paths available and provide incentives/motivation for them to move-on. Long-term side-by-side operation of 2 major versions can be an extremely costly operation. For this reason, you must plan to complete migrating all your customers within a scheduled period.
