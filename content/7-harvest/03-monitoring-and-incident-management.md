## What
_Monitor system health, detect and alert about system malfunctions and failures. While exception monitoring deals with problems within the product, incident management deals with problems on the larger stack of software and hardware._

## Why

Unmanaged exceptions and inccidents could lead to breach SLA (Service Level Agreements) with customer and face penalties and portray a negative brand image in the market place. 

## How

Exceptions and inccidents could occur in any software product, but having the right monitoring and management process will be able to minimize the negative impact of such inccidents.

- Understand the SLA requirements

- To cover areas of SLA have logging inplace within components and subsystems

- Have a monitoring tool to detect issue by analysing the logs, prioritize, diagnose

- Have a inccident reporting tool to manage the issue backlog

- Meantime users are able to report incidents 

- Based on the agreed SLA incident must be resolved in order to provide higher level of customer satisfaction

- A rootcause analysis of incidents needs to be performed in order to minimize similar issues being occured in the future.
