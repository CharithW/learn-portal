## Why

Any company operates on many external factors which are beyond control and a disaster could strike at any time. While you cannot really control how and when a disaster may happen, you could always control your preparedness for it and how you react to it.

Most disasters are about surviving a difficult period. Strength of your contingency measures and how well the staff is trained to carry out those contingency measures will have a huge impact on your survival. Therefore, how solid your contingency plan will have a huge impact on the survival of your business.


## How

Consider the following pointers when you want to establish a contingency plan.

- Create a contingency budget to be used in a rainy day. Set a side a small portion of your recurring revenue towards a contingency fund. Do periodic reviews on this and make sure a certain minimum amount is maintained.Alternatively you could also consider having contingency buffers in your financial calculations.

- Try to have a good knowledge about market conditions. Invest on market research and maximize your knowledge. This way you'll be able to predict any forcible disasters ahead of your competition.

- Do a self evaluation and identify critical assets and revenue sources in your company. Create a budget to safe guard those critical interests.

- Establish a plan with detail instructions with clear activity owners. Once a plan is created make sure that this is communicated to all staff leaving no room for assumptions.

- Carry our periodic drills to make sure everyone knows their role when a disaster struck.
