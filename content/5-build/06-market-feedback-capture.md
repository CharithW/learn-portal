## Why

- To help adjust and improve the product

  - Although the initial market research provided an idea about the user’s needs, only after the customers use the product, we can learn about all the advantages, flaws and their actual experience. Furthermore, the user’s needs and expectations evolve with time continuously. Therefore it is crucial to have mechanisms to capture market feedback in order to ensure that the end product will create the best customer experience.

- To measure customer satisfaction

  - Customer satisfaction is directly linked to business performance. Therefore, we need to make sure our customers are happy with our product. Naturally, capturing their feedback is the best way to find out their level of satisfaction and consequently to predict the business performance in the future. E.g. NPS (Net Promoter Score)

- Collecting feedback shows us value their opinion

  - By asking our customers for feedback (directly), we communicate that their opinion is important to us and they are involved in shaping your product. So they feel more attached to our company and listening to their voice, helps build stronger customer relations.

- A reliable source of information to other customers
  - Positive direct user feedback is a powerful means for marketing the product. Opinions provided by real users who have already used a product are more reliable source for information these days. Hence, many companies today incorporate review system in their services and products. E.g. Uber, AirBnb.

## How

1. Direct feedback:  Customers provide the feedback directly at any touch-point in the customer journey. It comes in the form of a survey, market research, written complaint, formal letter, or a forum/panel.
   a. Surveys
   Surveys are easy to set up, easy to send out, easy to analyze, and scale very well. We can either use a survey tool (e.g. SurveyMonkey) or incorporate it in our product. However, using surveys exclusively we’ll never understand the deeper reasons behind the user responses. It is good for a starting point.
   b. Feedback boxes
   It is important to have a structured process for capturing direct user feedback in the system. E.g. Feedback forms. Such mechanisms should be simple and easy to use as possible. Then having a process to respond to the feedback is equally important.
   c. Direct meetings/calls
   Sometimes having a one-to-one discussion is the best way to uncover many opinions.

2. Indirect feedback: This is the type of feedback which refers to instances when the customer is speaking about the product without the intention of giving feedback to the business. E.g. The feed from social media sites, review sites, customer care interactions conducted via phone, chat sessions, or email.
   a. Website reviews
   A website review is a review conducted by a computer user and published to a review site about the product. 
   b. Social media
   Social media feedback occurs when the customers post comments on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and a variety of other social media sites. 
   c. Community Forums
   A forum is an online “meeting place” that is used to engage with others to communicate and share knowledge about a wide range of topics participants are interested in discussing (not necessarily about the product).

3. Inferred feedback:  Derived feedback from transactional, behavioral and operational data associated with the customer experience or the customer journey across different touch-points. E.g. website click-stream data, purchase history or contact center data.
