## Why

Software applications don’t live forever. A time would come when you will need to take a decision to retire the software application they have been using -may be for years. This could either be replacing the entire product with a new one or a revamp of the existing one.

- New major release to retire an old version
- Retiring a module of the product
- Completely retiring the entire product

The process is also called as product retirement, end-of-life a product, product decommissioning and product sun-setting.

Below are some of the reasons why you may arrive to such a decision:

1. Old Technology Is Compromising Your Security
2. It’s More Cost Effective to Use Newer Technology
3. Outdated Software platform Has No Upgrade Path
4. Your new users require Better UX on a new platform
5. The business model change requires a different platform
6. The product is financially not performing well
7. The business is shutting down or you are no longer in that market

This would also bring additional benefits for the stakeholders such as:

- Significant cost savings on efficient platforms
- Better attraction of development talent
- Efficient utilization of critical resources
- Freeing up of headroom and budget so that resources and funding can be directed toward adding value to the business.

## How

The main activities to include on the end-of-life roadmap would consist of:

### Impact analysis

_Business Processes:_ Users were using the functionality to fulfill their business processes. You should understand the impact to the business processes and alternative means through they may minimize the impact.

_Parties affected:_ Subset of your customers, Internal teams and departments, partner organizations, resellers, etc.

_Integrations:_ Your product do not exist in isolation but rather interact with others systems in some way. You must identify the interactions, analyze them, and understand the impact of retirement.

_Financial:_ Your product was bringing revenue/profit to the company that will be lost due to the retirement. You need to plan to handle such in case of a major lose.

_Customer Goodwill:_ Customers have trusted you when they have decided to buy the product. You should handle the retirement of the product sensitively.

### Process, Milestones and dates

What is the detailed plan of discontinuing the product. Include an exit date and work back from that point.

### Internal Approvals

Product retirement is an important strategic decision for an ISV. There can be other departments etc. that are affected due to the decision. You need to keep your company stakeholders, executive staff and the whole organization informed and involved in the decision making.

### EoL Policy

It is also a good idea to develop an end-of-life policy for your company so that your customers is aware of the procedure of retiring a product. For example have a look at the [end-of-life policy of Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html).

This may include the release of sourcecode for other parties to carry on from there. And/Or specify other conditions such as:

- Technical support, workarounds, and bug fixes will stop.
- Support during the period between EoS and EoL (may only for paid support contract).
- Online support documentation, wikis, or forums may be archived or taken offline on a date.
- Requests for features will not be accepted.
- Validation of software installs may not work.
- Official training for the software may no longer be available.

### Customer communication

This is the most important step of your roadmap and many ISVs get this step wrong. You must give plenty of advanced notice so that your customers do not feel that the product they use is suddenly disappearing. You should communicate the

- reason for retirement
- customer impact
- migration paths
- alternatives
- last date of support (EoS)

You should also have alternative solutions to suggest to your customers.Either a third-party tool, partner offering or to migrate to a newer version you have developed.

### Update the documentation

You will need to update a wide range of documentation, including your sales scripts, website, operations and support procedures, enterprise architecture models, system portfolio documentation, administration documentation, and system overview documentation (to note that it's been retired).

### RACI and Execution

Develop a Responsibility Matrix (RACI - responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) to manage the execution of the migration. You may include following areas in your execution plan.

_Test the migration:_ You must test your migration tools in a similar manner that you would test a system during the Transition phase. While it is desirable, you may not have the luxury of a test environment that supports all of your customers, including all your data. If that is the case, make sure that the data you do have is a representative sample of the entire customer base.

_Migrate platform and data:_ You will most likely not be able to simply turn off access to a system one day and be done with it. You must accommodate your customers by notifying them appropriately of the upcoming retirement and assisting them in migrating to other systems.

_Data Archiving:_ The existing data, code, documentation, and other system artifacts must be properly archived so that it may be restored at a future date if required.

_System removal:_ This is often a complex task, as you must migrate and convert data, turn off access and remove all vestiges of the retiring system, and update all the others systems that interacted with the retiring system. It’s a good idea to take a complete backup of the system before you begin just in case you need to recreate the system in a hurry.
