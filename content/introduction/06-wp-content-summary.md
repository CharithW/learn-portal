Although products are developed iteratively, they go through a set of different "phases" in the product lifecycle over time. During each phase, there are certain "strategic activities" that have to be initiated. These are diverse and span across 4 main "areas of excellence": 

•	Market Sense
•	Technology Sophistication
•	User Experience
•	Customer Success

Learn more about the winning product content for each lifecycle phase.


## Explore

This is where you explore different possibilities before locking down on a focused product concept.

•	**Product Concept Pitch Desk:** Create a pitch deck (or equivalent) to present the idea to different stakeholders such as investors, partners and potential customers.
•	**Context/Competitor Analysis:** Research into current market state, domain trends and study existing competition to understand the context.
•	**Commercial viability:** Evaluate business/financial viability to ensure long-term continuity and ROI.
•	**Personas:** Analysis of related user personas to understand pains, gains and behavior of users.
•	**Value Proposition:** The primary value that the company promises to deliver to customers. This is the declaration of intent or company's brand statement to consumers to communicate what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves their sale.
•	**Service Blueprint & User Journey:** Understand different paths a user takes to accomplish goals using the product.
•	**Mega Trend Analysis:** Study current world & market trends to align the purpose for the product with a mega trend.
•	**Market Segmentation:** Gather information about potential target markets and customer segments and the pros/cons of focusing on each.


## Focus

Now that you have explored different avenues, start locking-down on a specific area with the best potential.

•	**Business Model Design:** Elaborate business context within the product, operate and achieve the business goals.
