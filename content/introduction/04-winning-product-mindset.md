## Continuous Validation
As with any other product, software products need to exist in a marketplace. Market forces are dynamic by nature. The product team must embrace this principle and adopt product-market-fit and technology to be sustainable in the market while deriving a higher ROI.

## Personality Traits
Emphasis on personality traits is vital to guide members to achieve inner transformation. It is a very personal and individualistic aspect that drives members to behave in specific ways and, at a fundamental level, helps everything else to accommodate comfortably.

### Product Researcher
The ability to explore any product subject matter finds what's suitable for the problem domain within a reasonable time frame.

### Product Ownership
Every member of the product team must have total ownership of the product to ensure they fully commit to making it successful. Its a fact that many startups fail due to team issues not necessarily in the product business model. One of the main issues of the teams is not taking ownership to delivering excellent products. A great way to increase the ownership of the product is to align career progression with the purpose of the product roadmap and authority to take care of different aspects of product and measure against the outcome.

## Product Innovation Accounting
Product by nature needs to be dynamically responding to markets and create value from early on. A good example is how a startup works by minimizing the cost and trying its very best to fit to market needs. For software products, traditional matrices are not suitable to measure the value creation that brings in by software products considering the product lifecycle it goes through. Eg. During the early phase of the product life cycle, there may not be enough customers to justify typical metrics however it may be possible to show the customer engagement and level of feedback this team has got so that team can align the product towards the market which will in turn gives additional revenue. 
Innovation accounting mindset within the Winning product model is the guiding force keeping the whole journey towards success in check. The team must be able to articulate and rally around key strategies of the product, and leading indicators for success from early on.

## Product Agility
The philosophy of minimizing waste is deeply rooted in TPS (Toyota production system), which essentially promotes how best to respond to the market dynamics and operational dynamics while reducing waste.
