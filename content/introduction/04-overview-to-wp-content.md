Although products are developed iteratively, they go through a set of different "phases" over time. During each phase, there are certain "strategic activities" that has to be initiated and given focus for. These are diverse and span across 4 main "areas of excellence". 

## Areas of Excellence
 - Market Sense
 - Technology Sophistication
 - User Experience
 - Customer Success

## Lifecycle Stages
Winning Product Canvas divides the product's lifecycle into 8 stages. It should be noted that these stages do not happen like a waterfall phases. They are iterative at product level, module level and even feature level. These stages differ in subtle but in very important means. Understanding the focus of each stage is important in understanding the strategic activities within it.

### Explore
This is the initial stage where founder conceive the idea to solve a problem he/she identified. It is important at this stage to take a holistic view into the problem domain and explore broadly. This is where you explore into different possibilities before locking down on a focused product concept.

Team should study and analyze different paths and possibilities the new solution may take. Activities include brainstorming for idea generation as well as studying competitive offerings, research publications from the market place. This phase is somewhat analogous to Divergence and Discover phases of Design Thinking process.

### Focus
During the explore stage, team usually comes up with vast amount of ideas and value propositions the product may offer. Success of a product has no direct relevance to the plethora of features it offers. A smaller set of cohesive, tuned (targeted) feature set is usually more effective than a large set of features. 

Focus is the stage to narrow down the attention to the most important aspects such as market segment, value proposition, brand story and the overall solution architecture.

### Immerse
Once the focus (niche) is defined, it is time to dig deep into to elaborate details required for solving the problem. During the immerse phase team should look into the details the solution features, associated costs, timelines, etc. A lot of 'what if' analysis take place and the base artifacts required for detailed planning is generated here.

### Plan
Since team has analyzed the impact of different variations during the immerse phase, they are in a position to create the initial plans for the rest of the project. Most of these plans are live documents that will be kept updated during rest of the stages. 

This is where team plan ahead the product development, implementation, operations without losing the ability to respond to market dynamics. It is important to understand, this is NOT about making a 'Big Plan Upfront', but base planning documents that can facilitate continuous planning throughout the lifecycle.

### Build
This is the stage you have the highest flexibility to change the solution implementation at a lower cost. Once the product passes this stage, changes become costly due to the involvement of other stakeholders such as customers. Therefore the team should make use of this stage to validate all the assumptions (technical, requirements, business) they have made during the previous stages.

Every requirement should be treated as an assumption with a plan to validate. Such validation can come in the form of MVPs, demos, user testing, architecture POCs, etc. During the build stage, you should consider onboarding pilot customers as testers to validate the primary value propositions. 

### Optimize
When you reach this stage all your major assumptions should be validated. Product UVP must be clear and willingness of the customers to pay for that value proposition has to be confirmed. This means most of the core features are available and tested by your early customers during 'Build' stage. 

During optimize you tune the product further to achieve the maximum performance. Also you will carryout testing required for it to be adapted by a bigger scale of customers. This means the product quality, stability, visual appearance, onboarding procedures, etc. should be made world-class during this stage.

### Harvest
This is the stage your product returns back the investment mostly. The focus of this stage is to retain happy and loyal customers, up sell more and get referrals to grow the business. You need very stable operational processes to respond to the customer issues and inquiries. Build and tune your sales and marketing processes to capture a greater market share.

### Retire
Regardless of how well the product is built and maintained, there is always a retirement time for products. Retirement can be called upon by a major technology or user behavior change in the market place. Such may require you to re-invent the technology platform / business model / user experience to keep an edge in the market. ISVs should be watchful to identify this need so that they are able to disrupt their own business model before a competitor does. 

When a next gen product is planned it is important to do it with minimal disturbance to the existing customers. There has to be clear and pain-free migration paths available and provide incentives/motivation for them to move-on. Long-term side-by-side operation of 2 major versions can be extremely costly operation. For this reason, you must plan to complete migrating all your customers within a planned time span.
