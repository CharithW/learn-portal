## What
_How to optimize system performance for best user experience, based on performance requirements and analysis on existing performance_

## Why
According user experience research more than 40% of users will abandon the software product if the page loading time gets delayed more than 2 seconds. If the product's business is also relying on API economy, poor product API performance can have direct impact on the revenue. 

## How

Software product has a collection of integrated subsystems and this can be viewed as a collection of nodes and connection. Performance is the level of throughput of node and latency of each connection. Higher the throughput and lower the latency its better for the overal performance of the product. 
Performance fine tuning will incur different level costs based on the tactics utilized hence its important to understand level of performance required for a product and use the most optimal set of tactics.

- Peformance Engineering

  - Identify architecturally significant requirements and isolate requirements related to performance

  - Derive performance benchmark

  - Identify tactics to ensure required performance level 

      - Tactics to ensure right level of performance for components and sub-systems

      - Tactics to minimize the latency of communication between components and subsystems 

- Performance Testing
  Throughout the product engineering lifecycle it is required to do performance testing based on benchmarks

  - In order to identify performance bottlenecks, performance testing is carried out in a simulated production environment with realistic data loads.

  - Types of performance testing;
    - Stress testing

    - Load testing

    - Scalability testing

- Performance Improvements
  - Once the list of issues identified components, subsystems and integrations are updated until it reaches the benchmarked performance levels.
