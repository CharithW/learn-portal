## What
_Plan and organize human resources, tools, documentation, training required, communication and troubleshooting capabilities to provide great customer service._

## Why
`A satisfied customer is one who will continue to buy from you, seldom shop around, refer other customers and in general be a superstar advocate for your business.` - _Gregory Ciotti_

If you keep your customers happy, they are more likely to use your product more and spend more with your business.

## How
- Define what it means by 'great customer service' and align with your brand values. Set the standards such as
- Response time
- Proactive engagement (e.g. through error detection)
- Conversational personality
- How the disagreements/complaints are handled
- Legal requirements of your agreements and the industry
- etc.
- Determine the channels through you support the customers. This could vary with the licencing agreement with the customer.
- Inbound channels (calls, chats, email, SM, Forums, etc)
- Channels for investigations (Remote desktop, Onsite visits, Event logs etc.)
- Setup automated help assistants and knowledge bases to reduce your operational costs and provide efficient responses by handling regular queries automatically.
- Hire and train your customer support staff who has customer-centric-mindset. Establish standard response procedures to have consistency across all staff. Train and set KPIs based on customer satisfaction and feedback.
- Setup the right tools and integration in between. The tool set may involve,
- Call Center Software,
- CRM,
- Help Desk Ticketing System,
- Social Media Monitoring,
- Remote assistance tools,
- Event Log Monitoring.
- It should also be noted that the most of the traditional tooling can be expensive, hence consider setting up a lean infrastructure as appropriate.
