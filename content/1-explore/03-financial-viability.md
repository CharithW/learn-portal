## Why

'Sometimes there is a gap in the market becuase there's no market in the gap' - Irene Bejenke Walsh. Products may have a good value proposition with an appealing message, however in financial terms if it cannot sell enough to cover expenses and make enough profit to sustain the business in the longer then there will be a considerable risk in pursuing the selected product idea. One might carry out financial viability assessments for each product idea to select which one is the best.


## How

- Addressible market size
  Market needs to be big enough to have customers to generate revenues to make the product business scalable. Identify the potential volumes that can be sold in this market. This will help the economies of scale considering the cost per sale.

- Breakeven Analysis
  Based on the market size next thing is to determine the price for the product in order to at least cover the costs / breakeven. E.g: if the breakeven price is already higher than the closest competitive product, it is a challenging operation to sustain in long term. It is recommended to do a detailed breakeven analysis to determine  viability. 

- Does ROI compensate for the financial risks involved?
  Two aspects to consider on this is time and money invested on the product and what is the compensation mode. In terms of money what is the return that would be expected and how long will it take to breakeven and make profits. 

  A good way to verify the assessment done based on above 3 aspect is to find out few comparable product companies and work out how these product business reached their breakeven and how long it took.
