metaDescription: "A user journey map is a visualization of an individual’s experience with a product or service over time and across different perspectives. Mapping these experiences is a vital part of being a human-centered business, and it is essential to look at both aspects — what the person experiences, and what went on outside of their view to make it happen. Customer journey mapping and service blueprinting are two complementary methods that can help us see both sides of our services.
Yet these two methods are often confused; what is a journey map, and what is a service blueprint, and how are they different."

## Why
  A user journey map helps a product team to find the answer to the “What if..?” questions. Also, a user journey map can be helpful when the company tracks quantitative KPIs. In this case, a user journey map has an opportunity to become a cornerstone of strategic recommendations.

### User journey map
  A user journey map is an excellent tool for UX designers because It visualizes how a user interacts with a product and allows designers to see a product from a user’s point of view. It fosters a more user-centric approach to product design, which ultimately leads to better user experience.


## How

### Journey Map
A journey map captures iconic experiences that customers have, from their point of view, the front stage of the service experience. When creating a journey map, you use customer narratives and customer data to plot their expertise over time, mapping what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, and interacting with them along the way.

- Identify the User Flows.
  - The steps that the user will take to achieve his goals. It can be the primary or sub-flows.These will be a series of activities.

- The Persona which interacts with the journey.
  - What personas interact with the main journey at a certain point.

- The Behaviors & Interactions of the particular user.
  - What the Persona does for a specific step. What are the actions taken by them?

- The Pain points.
  - What the hardships/obstacles the Persona has to go through to achieve his goal.

-  Rewards presented to the user.
  - What are the incentives given to the user to overcome pain points?

- The Emotions, a user might feel at this point.
  - What kind of emotions the user might get at a particular step. 

- The Expected Outcome.
  - If all things go well, what would be the expected result of the specific actions you are focusing on. 

- The Web Components.

  - The UI components which can be used in the interface. That may be updated at any time in the process.

### Supporting flows 
What journey maps and customer narratives don't show is the organization's internal workings to offer the product or service. The supporting flows uncovers and documents everything that goes on beneath the surface and the internal makeup of the organization that creates it. It is a data visualization of how your product or service works, the business logic workings of how the things customer experiences are produced. e.g.: Business logic to select the best cab for a taxi hailing app
