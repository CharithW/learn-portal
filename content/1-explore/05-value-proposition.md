## Why
A product or service is introduced to the market to provide a solution for a problem. It is required to understand the type of tasks sought by the targeted audience, the pains currently faced, and what gains they expect and how they measure it. Your product needs to provide relief to the pains faced by the audience, and extend the gains required by them. 

However, According to the research by Simon Kucher & Partners 2014, customers reject nearly 7 out of 10 new products and services launched to the market. The primary reason is for not being able to effectively cater to the pain points faced by the targeted audience as a reasonable price. 


## How
 The Value Proposition Canvas is widely used for this purpose, and when a proper link is built between the pains and the pain relievers provided of the target market, it is considered that the Problem-Solution fit and the Product-Market fit has been achieved. 

In a Value Proposition Canvas, there are two segments.

### The Customer Profile 
Portrays the tasks the target audience requires to do, the pain points and the gains & how gains are measured.
	1. Tasks
	2. Pain points
	3. Gains

### Value Map 
Portrays the products and services offered, the pain relievers offered and the gain creators for the targeted audience.
	1. Products & Services
	2. Pain relievers
	3. Gain creators

When the segments are identified, the mapping is reviewed by matching the pains and pain relievers, the gains, and the gain creators offered via the products and services to make the tasks of the targeted audience easy. 

Following is an image connecting the Value Map with the Customer Profile items.
