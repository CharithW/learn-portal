## Why
Theme of the product represents how you would want customer to perceive your product. This is the basis for branding and thus it must not be taken lightly. It is important to reflect this theme in every corner of the user experience and the developers should be both aware of and know how to apply this in their day to day work. Therefore, guidelines and standards on how to do that should be in place from the beginning of the product life cycle.


## How
Consider the following to enable developers to better integrate product theme into development.

- Theme establishment
Product theme should be in place now. Try to document the main principals of the theme and also try to understand the deep meaning of the design. Theme is more than just UI elements, it covers the interactions, user flows and user moods. 

- Establish theme guidelines and standards
It is also important to establish a theme guideline for developers to adhere based on the overall product theme. It should be detailed as possible and also should cover all different aspects of the user interface.

- Sample implementation
Try to have the product theme implemented in a small vertical from the very beginning. This will act as a reference for implementation for features to come.
