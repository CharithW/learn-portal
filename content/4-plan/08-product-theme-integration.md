## Why
Making your product roadmap to articulate your vision is challenging. But by grouping initiatives into themes, you can organize your roadmap into what it describes as customers and other stakeholders. Themes help you create a roadmap that creates a story

## How
- Company strategiec initiatives are good ways to identify road map themes. You can choose from a handful of high-level initiatives you want to accomplish 
- If you are industrious, the themes may contain one or more epics. They are rarely feature specific. 
- It is important to educate stakeholders on how you define the theme, how you measure success, and what the actual theme is.
