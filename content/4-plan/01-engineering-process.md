## Why
"Those who plan do better than those who do not plan, even though they rarely stick to their plan.” – _Winston Churchill_

A process approach makes the software engineering predictable and repeatable.

## How
Generally a product development process should cover requirements coming from following four different sources;

- Business requirements.
- Customer requirements.
- Legal requirements.
- Compliance requirements (eg: ISO 9001).

Once the requirements are identified those should be arranged and documented in following hierarchy;

- Policy.
- Procedure.
- Work instruction.
