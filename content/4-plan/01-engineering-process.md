## Why
"Those who plan do better than those who do not plan, even though they rarely stick to their plan.” – _Winston Churchill_

A process or a methodical approach makes the software engineering both predictable and repeatable. This also helps with communication by making all stakeholders aware of what needs to be done and the benchmark to access success at each product development stage.


## How
Generally a product development process should cover requirements coming from following four different sources;
- Feature requirements originated by customers.
- Technical tasks to achieve non-functional requirements.
- Legal and compliance requirements (eg: ISO 9001).

The purpose of your process should be to cover these requirements. Following aspects needs to be considered when laying the final engineering process.
- Development process
There are proven process available here. Small scale agile frameworks such as SCRUM and Kanban or large scale frameworks such as SAFe and Less can be considered to be adopted as a development practice.
- DevOps process
A good DevOps process can automate everything from Code reviews to infrastructure deployments. Consider building a DevOps pipeline which covers static code analysis, code reviews, functional & non-functional automated testing and infrastructure deployments.
- Quality engineering process
Consider establishing a good quality engineering process to capture critical requirements even before development, define thorough test cases and finally testing for both functional and non-functional requirements.
- Release management
Establish a release management process which ensures quality before releases, minimum downtime, customer communication and awareness.

Once the engineering processes are established, those should then be arranged and documented in following hierarchy;
- Policy.
- Procedure.
- Work instruction.
