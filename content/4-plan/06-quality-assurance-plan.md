## Why
QA plan is critically important to ensure the quality of the product or service.  It helps to,
- Ensure the quality of the product.
- Makes sure that the product meets the set regulatory standards mentioned in service level agreements.
- Monitor and control the level of quality and other matrices in order to analyse trends and thereby continuously improve.
- Describes the specific document standards, practices, procedures and thereby improves the communication within the team.
- Establish trust and confidence in the business among customers and helps the business compete with others in the same market.


## How
The end goal of quality management should be to come up with a end to end process to ensure quality of your product. There are two main aspects.

**Quality Assurance (QA)**
Quality assurance is about preventing a defect from ever happening. This is a proactive measure and focuses on following a correct procedure to prevent bugs. The following needs to be considered here.
- Understand the quality requirements of the product.
- Communication and build awareness to make sure that quality is viewed as a team responsibility.
- Build test cases around features and non-functional requirements.
- Invest on test automation.

**Quality Control (QC)**
Quality control on the other hand is about ensuring that a certain quality threshold is maintained by the product. This is a reactive approach to make sure that nothing that does not meet the quality requirements are shipped. The following needs to be considered here.
- Executing quality verification processes such as regressions and smoke testing.
- Making sure that DevOps pipeline fails when the automated tests fails.
- Making sure at least the non-functional requirements stated in the SLAs are tested. 

Considering both QA & QC aspects, the following actions can be used to build a test plan.
- Ensure Quality objectives are identified.
- Define QA Roles and responsibilities.
- Coordinate with developers, scrum masters, product owners. QA plan should be aligned with the other management plans such as risk management plan, change management plan and resource management plan.
- Define methodologies and standards. Risk management standards, project management standards, information security standards, data protection and privacy standards, business domain related standards, etc.. needs to be considered here.
- Determine QA tasks and time schedule.
- Gather details on testing, staging and production environments.
- Plan, review and audit. Thereby, continuously improve.
