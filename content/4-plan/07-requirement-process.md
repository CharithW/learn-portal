## What
This is basically the journey of converting users' needs into product requirements. Most importantly, this action describes about finding out what users are willing to pay for, translating that requirement into features that the product team understands and finally prioritizing them to product road-map based on potential gains and feasibility.


## Why
The main intention of a requirement process is to confirm that the correct requirements are captured. 
Product should ultimately solve customers' need and investigating and capturing the right requirement is crucial. Thereafter, documentation is also very important as it helps with retaining and communicating that captured requirements. This also act as evidence for any further clarification. 

The idea here should be to build a Win-Win strategy with product users. Product team should focus on identifying users correct problem and that they do not hesitate to pay money to get their problem solved.


## How
Following pointers will help with the requirement process.

- Early customer feedback
Focus on getting a feedback from users as early as possible in the development cycle. The idea here is to make sure that the investment of development is spent on features that customers are willing to pay for. Using the Lo/High fidelity prototypes that were discussed earlier, focus on getting users feedback on feature importance and pointers on usage improvements long before even the development starts.

- Customer Involvement
Include customers in the development life cycle. Have specialized people who works with customers and use this input to feature prioritization and ultimately to define the product road map. It is also important to be transparent about this with customer to think Win-Win.

- Data driven
The decisions made on the product road map and the feature prioritization needs to be derived from data analysis. Customer requirements needs to be scientifically obtained with a large enough data set to make decisions on what features benefits the entire customer base.
