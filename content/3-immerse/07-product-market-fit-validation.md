## Why
“The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit” - _Andreessen Horowitz_

Simply put, if you want your business to succeed, you need to build products that your target customers really want. In other words, the product you build needs to solve a real problem that exists with in the target demography. This also means that a business has found a way to serve their customers with more value additions and it also has found a set of customers that resonate with their product.


## How
There are four stages of product market fit.

- Stage 1
Discover your customers and get their feedback about the product/service that you are going to produce.
- Stage 2
Test your product with the customers to make sure it really resonates with them.
- Stage 3
Develop the product positioning and decide on your brand and product positioning.
- Stage 4
Verify  what you’ve done so far. Make sure that the customer feedback that you have, the positioning you’ve chosen and everything in between, is right.
