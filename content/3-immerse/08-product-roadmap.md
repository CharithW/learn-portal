## Why
Product roadmap states how your business is going to execute the strategy in order to achieve goals and vision of your company. This has several ultimate goals.

- Prioritization of work given the customer requirements
- Describes the mid to long term strategy
- Provide a guiding document for executing the strategy
- Get internal stakeholders in alignment
- Facilitate discussion of options and scenario planning
- Help communicate with external stakeholders, including customers


## How
Product road maps evolve with time. Based on which stage the project is, the focus can be changed in the road map. It is always best to create a road map at the start of each project and evolve it as the project grows. All product road maps will fall in to following three categories based on the different stages of the project.

- The no-dates road map
These are more flexible than road maps built on timelines. These are best for companies whose priorities changes constantly. This is best when the product is in early stages where information can change frequently.
- The hybrid road map
This type is best when the product is more mature. In this type, there are dates, but no hard dates. The road map can be organized based on monthly or quarterly goals.
- The timeline road map
These type of road maps are not needed until the product reach maturity where there are multiple departments involved with dependencies to each other.

The success of any roadmap depends on how it is prioritized. While there could be many criterion for prioritization, customer requirements or in other words what customers are willing to pay for should be given a high consideration here.
