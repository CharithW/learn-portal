## Why
An Estimate is the best faith prediction of the effort that will be expended to perform a task.  It has tolerance and distribution and may depend on other factors beyond the estimator's control.  An Estimate is the opinion of a professional.

Engineering estimations convey product managers how much cost and effort will be required for various engineering activities. It helps them to make informed decisions to control the project more efficiently and effectively.


## How
There are several methods to perform engineering estimations. They have their advantages and disadvantages. However, the most popular engineering estimation method is Task/Method estimation also known as "Bottom-up Estimation"

- Task/Method Estimation
We break large tasks or stories into discrete, easy to understand incremental tasks. These tasks can easily be assigned among project team members. Each task is comprised of task specification, Condition Of Satisfaction(COS), estimated time of completion, test functionaries,etc. Eventually, the more granular estimations are added up to understand the full picture.

- Heuristic Method/Comparison to Actual
It is also called analogous estimation. You use the knowledge of the company to find similar tasks to the one you are anticipating.
