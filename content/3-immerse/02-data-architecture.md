## Why
Data architecture provides meaning to all the data that is collected. On the one hand, this gives the system the ability to work with accurate information efficiently to solve the business problem. On the other hand, it gives a new opportunity to analyze and predict trends in information and thereby to generate business insights.

## How
It is important to have a top-down data architecture designed based upon business processes and operations
Usually, there are three different layers of data architecture.
- Conceptual Level Data Architecture Design
  - It should include
    - Data entities and data elements such as customers, products and sales
    - Required outputs for the clients and customers.
    - Security at each entity and each level
    - The relationships of the data entities, such as reference integrity, business rules, execution sequence.
    - Standards of data quality, operations, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Logical Level Data Architecture Design
  - It should consider,
    - Type of database and the data format to use e.g., NoSQL, Relational
    - The naming conventions and data integrity
    - Data archival/retention policies
    - Privacy and security information
    - Data Replications
    - Data Flows and Pipelines
- Physical/technology model
  - Provides the data mechanism for a specific process and functionality, or how the actual data architecture is implemented on underlying technology infrastructure.
Apart from the above, consider the different dimensions of collecting data such as time to be used for analytical purposes later on.
