## Why
Product positioning helps to place the product in the consumer's mind relative to competing products. E.g. Car companies position their products as fast, fun, exciting, fuel efficient etc. The ultimate goal of a positioning message is to identify positions in the market that represents unmet needs. If your product fills those needs better than any other product, you will be naturally differentiated from the competition.


## How
Following areas should be considered when positioning a product or service

- Long lasting
The positioning must be able to work for a long period of time. Generally, positioning should not be done on technological innovation as this can be copied or improved on.
- Clear and Coherent
The message needs to be obvious and clear to the customer.
- Distinctive
The positioning must allow the consumer to see the company as distinctive to be effective.
- Relevant
The positioning must be relevant to the consumer rather than to the company.
- Premise
A company needs to prepared to lose customers when position a product. E.g. When a radio station changes formats they will create a new position, often lose current listeners.


Types of product positioning

- Benefit
Created by the benefits offered by the product. E.g. The fuel economy of a hybrid car.
- Target
The positioning should make the consumer think that product belongs to them, not to others.
- Price
High pricing can position the product as a luxury, attracting high-end consumers. Low pricing also positions products.
- Distribution
Some products are only sold at certain locations/stores.
- Service
Various services offered help to position a product. E.g. Open 24/7. "No Hassle" return policy.
