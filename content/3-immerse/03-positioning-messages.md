## Why
Product positioning helps to place the product in the consumer's mind relative to competing products. E.g., Car companies position their products as fast, fun, exciting, fuel-efficient. The ultimate goal of a positioning message is to identify positions in the market that represents unmet needs. If your product fills those needs better than any other product, you will be naturally differentiated from it.


## How
The following areas should be considered when positioning a product or service.

- Long-lasting
The positioning must be able to work for an extended period. In General, positioning should not be done on technological innovation as this can be copied or improved on.
- Clear and Coherent
The message needs to be evident and clear to the customer.
- Distinctive
The positioning must allow the consumer to see the company as unique to be effective.
- Relevant
The positioning must be related to the consumer rather than to the company.
- Premise
A company needs to prepare to lose customers when positioning a product. E.g., When a radio station changes formats, they will create a new position, often lose current listeners.


Types of product positioning

- Benefit
By benefits offered by the product. E.g. The fuel economy of a hybrid car.
- Target
By making the consumer think that product belongs to them, not to others.
- Price
High pricing can position the product as a luxury, attracting high-end consumers. Low pricing also positions products.
- Distribution
Some products are only sold at specific locations/stores.
- Service
Various value added services offered help to position a product. E.g., Open 24/7. "No Hassle" return policy.
