## Why
High fidelity prototypes take us as close as possible to an accurate representation of the application's user interfaces and interactions. It is a computer-based interactive representation of the product closest to the final design in terms of details and functionality. The hi-fi prototypes cover the user interface (UI) of the product in terms of visuals and aesthetics and the user experience (UX) aspects in terms of interactions, user flow, and behavior.

The primary purpose of interactive prototypes is their use in the usability testing of the product and have target users validate it. It is important to test our product before launching it in the market to foresee any issues or failures. Getting the most out of the feedback can be done with a prototype that is closest to the final product in its detail and functionality.

In addition to validating designs, interactive prototypes can be used for presentations and pitches. When we want to communicate the designs and functionalities of our product to our team members, clients, or other stakeholders in the project. When the functional build of the software is not developed, a high fidelity prototype does the job very well.


## How
To create an excellent high fidelity prototype, we need to get all our ingredients ready. The followings are the prerequisites required for a quality outcome.  

- Prepare required visuals and user flows
- Identify all the transitions and animations that need to create between different objects or screens 
- Choose the right tool that fulfills the requirements 

When selecting a proper tool for creating a high fidelity prototype, the web has enough information on comparing the pros and cons of different types of tools that we can use for this. What is important here is that when choosing the most optimal prototyping tool, we need to base our decisions on practical considerations:

- Aesthetics of the produced prototype, in terms of visuals and interactions giving a natural feeling, how fluid the animations are, and so on.
- The availability of established interaction models in the software that we can use to drag and drop to create our prototypes quickly.
- Handling of assets, in terms of syncing with popular cloud-based platforms, ease of storing and searching holdings in the software, and ease of updating all instances when changing the source asset.
- Compatibility with Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, or any of our favorite tools to generate visuals.
- Ability to preview our prototypes across different-sized devices and platforms.
- Playback speed.
- Publishing capabilities to enable sharing with our clients and other stakeholders.
- Availability of library with standard UI elements to aid in creating quick screens.
- Collaboration, in terms of allowing colleagues or others to comment or feedback on features.
